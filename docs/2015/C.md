# [2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015) solutions in C

## Dependencies
- gcc
- make

---

>[!IMPORTANT]
> In the `src/2015/C` folder should be a `Makefile` that will build the `solution` files
>
> The `solution` needs the `problem input` (which is usually in the dayX folder or just a simple text.) to be passed in to run correctly.
>
> Example:
>```bash
>cd src/2015/C
>
># build the day1/part1 solution
>make day1/part1/solution
>day1/part1/solution input.txt
>```

## day1
- [ ] part1
- [ ] part2
