# [2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015) in C

>[!IMPORTANT]
> In the `src/2015/C` folder should be a `Makefile` that should contain the different targtets  
> that will build the `solution` files
>
> The `solution` needs the `problem input` (which is usually in the dayX folder or just a simple text.) to be passed in to run correctly.
>
> Example:
>```bash
># no example yet
>```
